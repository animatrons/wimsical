git clone "githublink"
npm init (to init our project, creates a json config package file)

npm install create-react-app (react package)
npm install concurrently nodemon --save-dev (dev dependencies, local only for test and preview, nodemon: a backend tool that will keep the server running for developement even if we made a change to index.js the server will still run)
npm install express cookie-parser --save (needed for backend)
npm install pg --save (node js client for postgres)
npm install body-parser --save (http interactions between front end and back end)

node server/index.js (to start the server)
(added script "nodemon server" to "server") npm run server

scripts added to the main json:
"dev": "concurrently \"npm run server\" \"npm run client\"", to run both the server and client
"client": "npm start --prefix client", 

"start": "node server", called by heroku when the server needs to start
"heroku-postbuild": "cd client && npm install && npm run build" called after heroku builds the app, its gointo change to the client folder where all the reactfiles are found, and then it will install the npm dependecies, and then after that 'npm run build' a react script that will convert the app to static web files this how the app is built

Deployment through the heroku cli:

heroku login
heroku create app-name //creating new app
heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev --name=database-nam //adding a postgres addon with the hobby-dev option for free deployment and naming the database
heroku addons:attach database-name --app=app-nam //attaching the postgres addon database to the app
heroku pg:psql --app app-name //* connecting to the database-name, this will open a pgsql command line env for managing the bd creating tables etc, exit with \q
git push herkou main //* pushes and builds the app from the git repo, this can be run each time the code has been changed to update the app, and the lates version will be transfered and built
heroku ps:scale web=1 // start the app: dynos for running a free instance just the 1 level web1
heroku open // launch the browser with the url where the app is running
