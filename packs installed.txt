git clone "githublink"
npm init (to init our project, creates a json config package file)

npm install create-react-app (react package)
npm install concurrently nodemon --save-dev (dev dependencies, local only for test and preview, nodemon: a backend tool that will keep the server running for developement even if we made a change to index.js the server will still run)
npm install express cookie-parser --save (needed for backend)
npm install pg --save (node js client for postgres)
npm install body-parser --save (http interactions between front end and back end)

node server/index.js (to start the server)
(added script "nodemon server" to "server") npm run server

scripts added to the main json:
"dev": "concurrently \"npm run server\" \"npm run client\"", to run both the server and client
"client": "npm start --prefix client", 

"start": "node server", called by heroku when the server needs to start
"heroku-postbuild": "cd client && npm install && npm run build" called after heroku builds the app, its gointo change to the client folder where all the reactfiles are found, and then it will install the npm dependecies, and then after that 'npm run build' a react script that will convert the app to static web files this how the app is built
